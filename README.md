In this notebook, I have tried to make a program to find out how a stock is performing during the corona outbreak

According to the site: https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/coronavirus-a-timeline-of-how-the-deadly-outbreak-evolved/
January 22 and March 11 were two of many important events regarding coronavirus.
(January 22: WHO hold on declaring international health emergency & March 11: WHO declares the outbreak to be a pandemic)
events like these cause panic in the stock markets

The time is divided the time into 3 timelines
Timeframe 1: Before January 22
Timeframe 2: After Jan 22 and before March 11
Timeframe 3: After March 11

I have taken into consideration the Closing prices,Opening price,Returns, etc of the Stock
and Total Cases, Cured, Deaths, Active Cases of Corona to do the analysis

This doesn't predict future prices. It is simply to understand how the stock that you give as input as performed in the various timelines
